# FarmLab
FarmLab is 3D printer manager designed for small to medium size print farms. It is a project of Ivan Guerrero under the supervision of Daniel Kupzik for the institute of production science at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. 
FarmLab allows you to control multiple OctoPrint instances and a TheSpaghettiDetective server in on place. It also allows you to extract historical data, by manipulating the "Print Job History" plugin for OctoPrint.
